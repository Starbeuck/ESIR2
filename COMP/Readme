#Compilation project

##To create an Xtext project in Eclipse

'''
file > new > Project > Xtext Project
Project name : org.xtext.example.Comp
Name : org.xtext.example.Comp
Extensions : py (because we choose to work on python file)
'''

Then, you will have a lot of folder available such as 
'''
org.xtext.example.Comp
org.xtext.example.Comp.ide
org.xtext.example.Comp.tests
org.xtext.example.Comp.ui
org.xtext.example.Comp.ui.test
'''

##How to create your own grammar ?
Open the first one folder called 'org.xtext.example.Comp', you will find a file 'Comp.xtext'. Here, you can write your grammar.

##How to test my own grammar ? 
Click right on Comp.xtext file and select 'Run as > Generate XText Artefacts'. Then click right on the folder 'org.xtext.example.Comp' and choose 'Run As > Eclipse Application'. You arrive in another Eclipse windows. Follow the next steps : 
'''
  1. File → New → Project… → Java Project 
  2. Click right on your new projet and then → New → File and call him "whatdoyouwant.py" (because we choose a .py extension before)
'''

Now, you can write into this new file and see if it respects your own grammar !
